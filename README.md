# What petitions say about your area

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BBC-Data-Unit/petitions/master/petitions_interactive.png)

In the wake of over a million people signing a petition against a state visit for US President Donald Trump ([report](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-38796357) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/trump-petition)) in February we reported on the areas of the UK most likely to sign petitions, and created an interactive feature allowing you to see where your area ranked.

The story was written by **Dan Wainwright** with additional research by **Ioana Dumitrescu**.

## Data

Data for each petition can be downloaded from [the official UK petitions website](https://petition.parliament.uk/) - a '*Get petition data (json format)* link is at the bottom of each petition page. Alternatively, you can just add `.json` to the end of any petition URL, e.g. the JSON link for the EU referendum petition at `https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215` is `https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215.json`
